            <h3>What is <b>The Bloomingdale Trail</b>?</h3>
            <p>
                The Bloomingdale Trail is the centerpiece of <a
                href="http://the606.org/">The 606</a>. It is an elevated, multi-use
                linear park being built (as of early 2015) on the unused Bloomingdale
                railroad, running nearly 3 miles west-to-east through the northwest side
                of Chicago.
