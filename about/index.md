title: About Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail
---

### Mission

The mission of the Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail Park Advisory Council is to
be the community stewards of the Bloomingdale Trail, the centerpiece of The 606,
by having an independent voice while working closely with all stakeholders of
The 606, to ensure that the trail is a vibrant, inclusive part of the
Bloomingdale corridor.

### Purpose & Goals

* To sponsor and promote open communication on matters relating to the Bloomingdale Trail with and between all communities along and users of the Trail and the 606 partners (the City of Chicago, Chicago Park District and the Trust for Public Land).
* To advocate for, facilitate and support opportunities for direct community engagement (e.g. arts, health, economic inclusion) and to promote robust community involvement.
* To ensure a healthy balance between the Bloomingdale Trail as a neighborhood amenity and a regional and international attraction.
* To preserve the history and life of the Bloomingdale Trail from the 19th century to the present.
* To assist in raising funds and resources to enhance the Bloomingdale Trail.

### About Friends

Neighbors came together in 2003 to found Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail.

The **original mission** of Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail was:

1. Preserve the elevated right of way
2. Beautify the public space
3. Create a new, mixed-use trail/linear park
4. Establish a broad coalition that supports the proposed park
5. Connect with neighborhood schools and institutions

Now that we have achieved our long-time goal of advocating for the construction
of this trail, which is currently underway and the Trail will be open this
summer, June 2015, we are continuing to focus on ongoing community engagement
and stewardship.
