The foreground of a weedy, unkempt, abandoned Bloomingdale Line contrasts with the mixed built environment of Bucktown -- a blend of building heights, ages, sizes, and styles, but where the most prominent buildings are new, boxy, and polished. One photograph shows the private face of Bucktown's showy buildings, back yards and back porches that front onto the railroad viaduct. These blocks bracketing the Bloomingdale Line exhibit an urban environment caught in transition, fitfully shifting from industry that relied on the railroad to vacant lots to a high-amenity residential environment of well-groomed roof decks.These photos illustrate two afternoons spent on the Bloomingdale Line in June 2009.

      "description": "I lived in an apartment on Bloomingdale avenue for a little longer than a year. My windows faced the defunct embankment. On a daily basis I walked along it or underneath it, interacting daily whether consciously or not. Its painted white omnipresence seemed always just a glance away. Stark and immovable, yet frequently vandalized, eroding, and impermanent. These images are an excerpt of works made while walking the length of the embankment. They are thoughts, reflections, and interactions with the structure as it bisects the ever-changing surrounding neighborhood, ever-changing in its own right.",

            "description": "Through my photo series, “Abandoned Practices,” I document objects that have been cast aside by society. I am interested in exploring how these objects take on new meaning when left in a setting that is usually far from its original home and purpose. I have found a lot of inspiration in Chicago for this series. One of my favorite places to photograph is along the Bloomingdale Trail. The trail is full of discoveries, ranging from strange discarded items to unusual architecture. Living in close proximity to the trail has allowed me to watch the changes being made over the past few years. My walks along the trail also encourage me to reflect upon Chicago’s past, present, and future, as observed through the changing snapshots of neighborhoods.",

            "description": "Currently the Trail exists in an appealingly raw and unmanaged state, reflecting the passing of the railroad era as it inexorably reverts to a natural environment in the post-industrial landscape. There are miles of empty walls, abandoned trestles and overpasses, iron bridges and industrial detritus. Along the way are graffiti tags, broken bottles, metal artifacts, and indefatigable nature, reclaiming it all.\nUsing digital tools and industrial materials along with photography, painting, drawing and collage, my work explores the interface of nature and technology. Variations in scale reveal recursive patterns, referencing visible structures in nature, macroscopic or microscopic views, or complex network visualization in topography and computing. I seek a common language: order and complexity, the organic and the built, the rational and the intuitive, the mark of the hand and the mark of the machine.\nReflecting my interest in specific local environments, I photograph on-site and render the images into abstract forms, pairing and integrating the human/industrial detritus with corresponding forms from nature. I am interested in the primacy of color, pattern and visual complexity in connecting the viewer to the environment.\nThese images are proposals for public art installations along the Bloomingdale Trail. They are intended to bring attention to the unique qualities of this urban space, and to engage the public in helping to move the park project forward. As of now they are unfunded. I hope that public exposure may lead to their realization.",

After seeing the great things that could be done with the abandoned elevated train lines of New York I wanted to see what possibilities might exist for the Bloomingdale Trail  to create a similar urban park.\nMy photos document a tour of the Bloomingdale Trail starting from the concrete caverns of the expressway overpass at Ashland Avenue to the still active rail yard at Drake Avenue. Along the way I was treated to the sights and sounds of the diverse neighborhoods that could be served by this development. The richness and variety of the ever changing scene suggest that this project has the potential to be considerably more interesting than the High Line.",

Looking up and down I pass concrete pillars, bridges, lintiles, massive footers, wobbly sidewalks, ancient metal lights and steel railings that support and adorn the tracks above. Of interest to me are the visual intersections of past and present on the edges of the line.\nAt street level both history, culture and infrastructure meet. Colorful murals, graffitti and peeled paint mix freely against angular concrete edges which wrestle with decayed waterfalls of stone and rusted metal. Pictures only mankind, light and time can create.\nOne day I’ll ride above on the Bloomingdale Trail. Straight as the crow flies to the river, without diesel trucks or volcanic potholes. And down below a blank canvas will pass by. Fresh construction and the start of a new asthetic. A second marrage of images, industry and entropy.",

            "description": "As a resident of the neighborhood where the Bloomingdale Rail passes through, I attempt to capture the architecture of the line as a part of the neighborhood. The Bloomingdale Trail, with its history and style, is just as much a part of the Wicker Park, Bucktown, Humboldt Park, and Logan Square neighborhoods and culture as the residents, architecture, and local establishments that call them home.\nMy goal is to capture the trail, as it exists today, to be remembered by future generations before it becomes converted to a multi-use park. The still-vibrant colors and industrial style of the trail evoke a feeling of history come alive; helping to define the culture and feeling of the neighborhood it passes through.\nMy personal fascination with the industrial urban architecture shows in my photographs. The photos for me evoke the imagination of what the rail line once was, an industrial fixture of the city, and what it can be, a repurposed park to be enjoyed by the residents who have replaced the trains who once traversed the neighborhoods it passes through.",

The railway tracks would be left in at places, as will some of the wilderness and track ballast. Development would be via sustainable methods and materials, with an intention of conserving and showcasing the Trail’s, Chicago’s, the adjoining neighborhoods’ histories.

            "description": "This collection of photographs focuses on the contrast between the wilderness that developed on the all-but-abandoned Bloomingdale Line and the housing developments that grew around it. It also touches on the strange absurdities that abound along the trail, inexplicable things such as shoes tied by their laces atop of cable that forms a “gate” above the trail and the collection of religious statues someone left on the roof of one of the nearby houses. As it is, the Bloomingdale Line is a unique mixture of the wild and the cultivated – something that will doubtlessly be lost once the trail is developed.",

Starting at the eastern end of the embankment, the Building Society planted a stake every 1/8 mile along the rail-bed. We asked participants to share their observations of the built environment at each stake, either by depositing comments or materials in an envelope attached to each stake, or by using hashtags to identify digital submissions. In addition to the 1/8th mile stakes, 'wildcard' stakes were driven at the request of participants, when unique situations were encountered along the embankment.",

            "description": "Chicago’s history is the story of a dirty, industrial trading post that evolved into a hip, beautiful center of progress. In many ways, the Bloomingdale Trail—and the changes it is currently undergoing—represents a microcosm of this same urban transformation. A three mile stretch of land that long helped expedite industry in North America, but later became stagnant, is being revitalized into a public place of modern beauty and urban facility. With these five photographs, I sought to use cutting edge creative techniques to portray the more industrial characteristics that have been left behind by the Bloomingdale Trail’s past, together with the natural beauty that has emerged over the last several years. Using high- dynamic range photography, long exposure, and micro four-thirds technology, I hope to capture the Bloomingdale Trail’s present personality, its history, as well as a hint of its potential for the future.",
