### Come cut the ribbon on The Bloomingdale Trail with your neighbors and be among the first up top!

On **Saturday, June 6, at 8 a.m.**, we will gather at each of the 12 access points
along the Trail for fun twists on the traditional ribbon cutting. These
ceremonies will celebrate the neighbors who advocated for more than a decade to
help make the dream of the Trail a reality. Come meet those who saw the
potential in the old Bloomingdale Line and believed it could be transformed
from something that divided communities into a something that weaves us
together.
