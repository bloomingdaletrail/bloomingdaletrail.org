This coming Sunday, October 5th is the inaugural <a href="http://www.biketraffic.org/content.php?id=1550_0_8_0">Sunday Parkways</a> as parts of the boulevard system are shut down to cars between 9am and 1pm.  Bring a bike, bring a friend and bring an open mind about how public space can be used in Chicago.  And as you glide or walk along Humboldt Boulevard, look up! It's the Bloomingdale Trail.  Also happening Sunday and passing under the trail: <a href="http://www.bucktown5k.com">Bucktown 5k</a>.
