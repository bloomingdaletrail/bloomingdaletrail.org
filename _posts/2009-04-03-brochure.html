<p>With spring here, more and more people are out and about exploring the Trail. To help them in their travels, we thought it’d be a good idea to do a fresh distribution of the FBT brochure and map.</p>
<p>As friends of the Trail, no doubt you’ve seen our beautiful brochure, which opens up into along, multi-paneled map highlighting planned access points, cultural institutions and parks. But we know there are thousands of future friends out there who haven’t had the opportunity to learn about Chicago’s next great park.</p>
<p>Join us this Sunday, April 5th from 3:00pm–6:00pm for an FBT brochure distribution day. We'll meet at the corner of Leavitt and Milwaukee (a future access point), divide into partners, give everyone a supply of brochures and then spread out in all directions. Our focus on this day will be to distribute brochures to businesses and to areas where FBT has fewer friends. Please rsvp to <a href="mailto:ben@bloomingdaletrail.org">ben@bloomingdaletrail.org</a> if you plan to attend.</p>
