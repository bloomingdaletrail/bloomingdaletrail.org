<H4>Second place for The Friends of The Bloomingdale Trail at the Patagonia "Voice Your Choice" campaign!</H4>
<P>FBT was awarded with $1,500 of grant money from Patagonia for our strong turnout and support.</P>
<P>Openlands won first place with Active Alliance coming in at 3rd. We lost with a small margin of 15 votes to Openlands.</P>
<P>We would like to thank everyone who came out to vote and helped spread the word to others! A big thank you to the crew at Patagonia for including us this year and for supporting us and other green initiatives!</P>
<P>A special&nbsp;thank you also goes to Julia Kim, who took great&nbsp;initiative in getting FBT involved with this event and donated her time and presence to the&nbsp;campaign.</P>
<P>With your continued help and support, next year will get first place!<SPAN id=_marker>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN style="FONT-SIZE: 6.5pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA" mce_style="FONT-SIZE: 6.5pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"></SPAN></P></SPAN></SPAN>
