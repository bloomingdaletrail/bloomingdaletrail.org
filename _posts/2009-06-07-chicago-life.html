<p>If you live in Chicago and get the Sunday edition of the New York Times, you get a copy of the local interest magazine <a href="http://www.chicagolife.net/"><em>Chicago Life</em></a> as an insert with your paper.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.chicagolife.net/images/1244327369_0.0283569507981886.jpg?1244327369">cover photo</a> of this week&rsquo;s issue delivered earlier today is a nighttime vista from up on top of the Bloomingdale Trail, taken by Chicago&rsquo;s own <a href="http://davidschalliol.com/">David Schalliol</a>. Some of you may already be familiar with David&rsquo;s work through his acclaimed &ldquo;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/metroblossom/sets/72157594559122599/">Isolated Building Studies</a>.&rdquo; If you haven&rsquo;t already, do check out that link to his Flickr set, it&rsquo;s worth your time.</p>
<p>This is a good opportunity to remind everyone of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/bloomingdaletrail/">Bloomingdale Trail group on Flickr</a>. It&rsquo;s open to anyone, so if you&rsquo;ve been up or around the Trail and have taken digital photos, you can share them easily with the community. There&rsquo;s over 400 images there already, some terrific stuff. Feel free to add yours, and we&rsquo;ll be featuring some of the best on this site coming soon.</p>
