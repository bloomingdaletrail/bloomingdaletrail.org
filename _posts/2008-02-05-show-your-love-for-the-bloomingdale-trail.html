<p>We've been hearing rumors that its good luck for lovers to kiss beneath
the Bloomingdale Trail. Sounds like a fine idea to us! To help embrace
the romantic side of Bloomingdale we're inviting Friends of the Trail
to a special event â€¦

<p>A $30 suggested donation gets you a ceramic tile to design with your
own declarations of love and compimentary beer to enjoy while you
create. Our hope is to one day mount the tiles on the trail itself!
