	<p>Our sister project in New York, <a href="http://thehighline.org/">the High Line</a>, is the subject of an interesting <em>New York Times</em> piece by architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff, on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/24/arts/design/24ouro.html?ex=157680000&#38;en=cf30031f63f0ed8c&#38;ei=5124&#38;partner=permalink&#38;exprod=permalink">impact the proposed greenway is having on development in the neighborhoods</a> it runs through, from zoning decisions to gentrification to developer plans.</p>

	<p>To be sure, the High Line is being built under conditions that are very unique to the Manhattan environment, but as our own greenspace project progresses, it&#8217;s worth noting how this and similar efforts are dealing with issues like how the access points will be integrated with the residential and commercial spaces, to name but one.</p>
