<H1>A Very Successful 2nd&nbsp;Annual Albany-Whipple Service Day! </H1>
<H3>25 neighbors and nature enthusiasts came out on October 10, bore the cold and the wind and helped clean up the park. </H3>
<H3>We planted 100 daffodil bulbs, weeded, mulched, racked leaves and picked up debris. </H3>
<H3>There were small organic pumpkins for painting (and eventual consumption), face painting, donuts from our friends at Dunkin Donuts and coffee donated by Starbucks. The event was very successful and we are very proud of what we accomplished!</H3>
<H3>The event was very successful and The Trust for Public Land and the Friends of the Bloomingdale trail would like to thank everyone who came out to help and support the park!</H3>
