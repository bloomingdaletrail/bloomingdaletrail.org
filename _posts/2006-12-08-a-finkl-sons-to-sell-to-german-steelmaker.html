	<p>Located at the eastern end of the Bloomingdale Line, A. Finkl & Sons has been a fixture on Chicago&#8217;s north side and its potential closure would mean big changes for the neighborhood.  Finkl is one of the few remaining users of Canadian Pacific&#8217;s freight service to Goose Island, which previously used the Bloomingdale Line. Remaining freight users include Peerless Candy, General Iron and Big Bay Lumber.</p>

	<p>From the <a href="http://www.finkl.com">press release:</a> </p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>A. Finkl & Sons Co., a specialty steel forging company on Chicago’s North Side, today announced it has signed an agreement to be acquired by SCHMOLZ+<span class="caps">BICKENBACH</span> AG, a leading global producer of high-grade steels headquartered in Dusseldorf, Germany. With the acquisition of Finkl, Schmolz+Bickenbach will become the world’s largest tool steel producer. Finkl, a dominant presence on Chicago’s North Side for more than 100 years, has outgrown its present location and sought a partner with the same commitment to excellence to make the necessary investments in construction of a new plant, the company said in announcing its merger plans.</p>
