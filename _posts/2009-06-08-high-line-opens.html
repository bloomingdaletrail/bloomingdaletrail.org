<p>What an exciting day. Congratulations to our friends to the northeast in New York City today on the <a href="http://www.thehighline.org/news/2009/06/08/we-did-it-high-line-opens">opening of the High Line</a>!</p>
<p>The High Line is a fantastic project that's already captured the imagination of New Yorkers and so many others. We at Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail commend Friends of the High Line for their diligent efforts over the past decade bringing this spectacular urban park to life.</p>
