Mayor Richard M. Daley introduced an ordinance into the Chicago City Council on March 14th to give the Department of Planning and Development authority to acquire two parcels of land for the creation of a community park and future access point for the Bloomingdale Trail.

<p>The parcels at 1809 and 1811 N. Albany Ave. would be combined with land the city is currently acquiring on the 1800 blocks of North Albany and Whipple Street.

<P>"Our efforts to identify and acquire land for the development of a community park in Logan Square will benefit young and old alike," said Mayor Daley. "This will provide a safe and healthy atmosphere where children can play and older residents can socialize with neighbors."

<P>Once acquired, the property would be assembled into a single 27,800-square-foot parcel and turned over to the Chicago Park District for development.
