<p>Last Wednesday night, December 10, there was a standing room crowd of approximately 80 people at the Near Northwest Arts Council.  They were waiting to see students from Purdue University present their designs for the Bloomingdale Trail.  This was the final review, or exam, for the students, landscape architects in their senior year.  They had spent the last semester studying the Bloomingdale right of way, the adjacent neighborhoods, and various design theories.  For more than three hours, students presented six different visions for the future Bloomingdale Trail.  The work was thorough, creative, and, in one notable case, exciting, bold, and achievable.

<p>This program dovetailed nicely with the recent deadline for the city of Chicago's request for proposals for the preliminary design of the Bloomingdale Trail.  As one commentator said on Wednesday night, the students's work will now be the measure against which the professionals' proposals will be measured.  Fortunately for everyone interested in the Bloomingdale Trail, Professor Kim Wilson, whose studio this was, has agreed to make the students' work available digitally.  We will notify you when the work is posted.
