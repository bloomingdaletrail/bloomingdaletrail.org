<p>Are you an educator working near the Trail? FBT&#8217;s <a href="/committees/education">Education Committee</a>, headed by board member <a href="/about/board/amber-kleeschulte/">Amber Kleeschulte Richard</a>, has created some great new resources for you to download.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong><a href="/pdfs/Education_Resource_Packet_Feb_2009.pdf">Education Resource Packet</a></strong> is a in-depth guide of education goals, student activities, background of the FBT organization and the Trail project, and links to further informational resources.</li>
<li><strong>&#8220;<a href="/pdfs/Bingo_Board.pdf">Bingo on the Trail</a>&#8221;</strong> is a bi-lingual PDF you can download and print out for exploring and identifying common objects along the Trail.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many thanks to Amber and the committee for pulling together these materials. The Trail is a great resource in and of itself for your classroom: it&#8217;s perfect for learning about transportation, Chicago history, cultures and communities near the Trail, politics and urban planning, and local environmental issues, to name a few. Check out these materials, <a href="mailto:info@bloomingdaletrail.org">contact the committee</a> to get involved, and be sure to download these documents and take advantage of them for your curriculum planning.</p>
