<p>The <em>Chicago Tribune</em> <a title="Chicago trail supporters see a gem on the tracks" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-bloomingdale-trail-city-zonejun10,0,69430.story">featured the Bloomingdale Trail today</a> on the front page of its Chicagoland Extra section.</p>
<p>The article touches on many important aspects of the project, including providing more green space to Logan Square, connecting Humboldt Park, Wicker Park, Bucktown, and Logan Square neighborhoods, addressing childhood obesity through greater outdoor activity and mobility, concerns about gentrification and crime, and the Trail&rsquo;s context within the <a href="http://burnhamplan100.uchicago.edu/">Burnham Plan Centennial</a>.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out a print copy of the article which features photos of FBT&rsquo;s own Ben Helphand and TPL&rsquo;s Beth White.</p>
