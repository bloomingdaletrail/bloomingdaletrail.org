<strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong> <br>

<h3>City selects firm for Bloomingdale Trail work</h3>

<h4>ARUP team has experience on similar projects</h4>

<p>The City of Chicago has selected ARUP North America Ltd to begin
preliminary design and engineering work on the Bloomingdale Trail, a project to
convert an unused elevated rail line to a 2.7-mile multi-use path.</p>

<p>ARUP was one of 23 firms that responded to a request for proposals seeking
qualified firms for the work. The City selected five teams for interviews about
their vision and qualifications for the Trail project. The five teams each
included strong interdisciplinary experience (design, architecture, planning),
experience with other projects of similar magnitude, and success in
incorporating community input into creative and sustainable design.</p>

<p>ARUP was chosen following team interviews, reference checks, and extensive
deliberation by a committee comprising several city departments and agencies
including the Department of Zoning and Planning, Department of Cultural
Affairs and the Chicago Park District. The team showed outstanding strengths
in all of the criteria.</p>

<p>ARUP is a global firm with expertise in the design, engineering and construction
disciplines. Among its projects are engineering the “Water Cube” aquatics
center for the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the California Academy of Sciences in
San Francisco, the world’s largest highly sustainable public space.</p>

<p>The ARUP team features nine sub-consultants, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chicago-based Ross Barney Architects, which has worked on several
Chicago projects including Wacker Drive and the Chicago Riverwalk</li>
<li>Brooklyn-based Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, which worked on
New York City’s High Line, similar in concept to the Bloomingdale
Trail</li>
<li>Chicago-based Burns &amp; McDonnell engineers, which has worked on
many large Chicago infrastructure projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>“We are looking forward to working with ARUP to turn part of Chicago’s
industrial heritage into a green oasis,” said Beth White, Chicago Area Director,
The Trust for Public Land. “We applaud the city for its commitment to this
visionary project and we are proud to be a partner in such an inclusive planning
process that also calls for the highest standards for design and innovation.”</p>

<p>The project entails extensive civic and community involvement from the Trust
for Public Land, the Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail and other entities. As
part of the design process, Trust for Public Land will host a future public design
charrette process in conjunction with CDOT.</p>

<p>The Bloomingdale Trail will run from Ashland to Ridgeway using the elevated
rail embankment along Bloomingdale Avenue (1800 North). The project was
recommended in the Logan Square Open Space Plan produced by the Dept. of
Planning and Development (today known as the Dept. of Zoning and Planning).</p>

<p>Chicago has approximately $3 million in federal and local funding for project
design. CDOT is still working to identify construction funding for the project.</p>
