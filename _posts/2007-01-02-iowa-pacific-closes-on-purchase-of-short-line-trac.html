According to a report from the <A href="http://www.leedcouncil.org">LEED Council</A>,  Iowa Pacific Holdings, LLC has closed on the purchase of the short-line track east of the proposed trail from Candaian Pacific.  Serving companies like Big Bay Lumber, General Iron and Peerless Confections in the North River Industrial Corridor, this track runs east of the Union Pacific tracks along I-90/94 and crosses the Chicago River. Iowa Pacific plans to continue all existing service and are interested in attracting new rail users to sites in our area that are accessible to the track.
