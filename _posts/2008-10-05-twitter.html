<p>For those of you who use the social networking
website <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>,
you can now follow Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/thebloomingdale">@thebloomingdale</a>. We&#8217;ll
continue to blog regularly but we&#8217;ll use Twitter to post quick updates.</p>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t familiar with Twitter, it lets you post short messages
from your mobile phone via text message or via the Twitter website,
and you can &#8220;follow&#8221; others who do the same and read their posts. It&#8217;s
similar to blogging but meant for shorter, more timely updates.</p>
