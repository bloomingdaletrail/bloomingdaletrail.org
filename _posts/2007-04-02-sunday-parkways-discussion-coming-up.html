	<p>Our friends at <a href="http://biketraffic.org/">Chicagoland Bicycle Federation</a> are hosting a discussion Wednesday, April 11, 2007, from 6:30 to 7:30 P.M. to go over the Sunday Parkways program. It&#8217;s a chance for you to learn about it, which would turn certain Chicago streets into parks for a few hours every Sunday, and to voice your concerns, comments, and questions.</p>

	<p>Definitely check it out: head on over to <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/171139/">Upcoming.org for details</a> and you can let everyone know if you plan to attend. See you there!</p>
