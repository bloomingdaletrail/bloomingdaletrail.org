	<p>This week&#8217;s Chicago Reader is a special issue on Logan Square, one in a series the Reader is doing about Chicago&#8217;s neighborhoods. The <a href="http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/logansquare/bloomingdaletrail/">Bloomingdale Trail</a> is featured as one of Logan Square&#8217;s highlights. Of course, it&#8217;s also a highlight of Humboldt Park, Wicker Park, and Bucktown, as well as the rest of the City, but we&#8217;re proud  that people are starting to see the Trail as a prominent part of their neighborhood&#8217;s future.</p>
