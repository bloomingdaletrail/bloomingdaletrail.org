<P>"Throughout the Rust Belt and around the world, remnants of the industrial era are being repurposed to give new vitality to urban spaces. In New York City, the High Line has become one of the city’s most innovative, inviting public spaces. In Chicago, the Trust for Public Land, the Chicago Park District, and Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail are creating an elevated, mixed-use, linear park and trail by repurposing an unused freight rail embankment above Bloomingdale Avenue. University of California–Berkeley professor <STRONG>Walter Hood</STRONG> focuses on the specific cultural, environmental, and physical complexities of city and neighborhood landscapes. In this program, he articulates how the Bloomingdale Trail advocates for a larger movement to reclaim erstwhile industrial space for public use as green space."</P>
