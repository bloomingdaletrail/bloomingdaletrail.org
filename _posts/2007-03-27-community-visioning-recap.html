It was a big day for all of those reasons, but also because we kicked off a process that will culminate in a community                        
vision for the Trail that will flow into the City of Chicago's official                             
design process.</p>

Manny Flores, and Beth White" style="float: left; padding-right: 5px;"></a>Over 70 community residents and activists, along with design and architecture experts and <a href="http://civicfootprint.org/geography/ward/1">Alderman Manny Flores</a> of Chicago&#8217;s 1st Ward were on hand to brainstorm, discuss and collaborate on their ideas for the Trail. They marked points and drew routes on maps of the area, came up with lists of interesting uses and features, and with the help of the experts, began to flesh out what the Trail might look through sketches.</p>

	<p>This process will continue over the next 6 months or so, in smaller settings throughout the neighborhoods. A report will be drafted over this time and revised with the ideas incorporated from each session. Ultimately, the final report will be presented to the City of Chicago. If you or your organization would like to get involved, contact Ben Helphand, <a href="mailto:helphand@gmail.com">email</a> or phone (773-677-7970).</p>
