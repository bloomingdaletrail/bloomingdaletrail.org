<p>Join us in opening a new greenspace adjacent to the future Bloomingdale Trail.  New sod is coming this week and on Saturday, Oct. 25th, weâ€™ll be planting flower bulbs, cleaning up and celebrating the new community space and garden.  Food and refreshment will be provided and there will be pumpkin decorating for the kids.  So bring the family and some gloves if you want to help dig.  <P></p>
<p>Are you interested in helping to maintain this garden and advocating for the Bloomingdale Trail? Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail is forming an advisory committee of neighbors near the Albany-Whipple park and we need your participation.  Sign up at the event or <a href="mailto:info@bloomingdaletrail.org">email us</a>.<P></p>
