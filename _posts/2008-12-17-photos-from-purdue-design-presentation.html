<p>Last Wednesday night, Purdue University Landscape Architecture Program’s Senior Urban Design Class of ‘08 presented a set of designs for the Bloomingdale Trail, a class project they’d been working on this semester. There was a great and enthusiastic turnout by community members and interested observers, as dozens braved the cold weather to attend. Representatives of FBT, Trust for Public Land, CDOT, and the Park District provided critiques, and the presenters fielded questions from the audience. There was some professional-quality work among the presentations, and the entire event opened eyes to the concrete possibilities and details of a future trail: it was easy to imagine yourself interacting with a real-life Bloomingdale Trail as each team gave a tour of their plan.
