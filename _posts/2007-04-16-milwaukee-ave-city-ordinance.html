	<p>The City of Chicago is acquiring land adjacent to the Bloomingdale rail embankment at Milwaukee Avenue in the Wicker Park/Bucktown neighborhood for the purpose of converting them to parks and future access to the Bloomingdale Trail. Trust for Public Land will purchase the parcels of land from their current owners and turn them over to the City. This is terrific news, as Milwaukee Avenue has been seen as a key access point for the Trail for some time, the first likely access east of Western Avenue.</p>

	<p>This development follows the securing of the future &#8220;pocket park&#8221; and access point at Whipple & Albany Avenues.
