The City of Chicago introduced an <a href="http://www.ci.chi.il.us/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_EDITORIAL/Kimball_1.htm">ordinance</a> on December 12th to accept a land donation from the <a href="http://www.tpl.org/tier2_rl.cfm?folder_id=588">Trust for Public Land</a> "in connection with the establishment of the Bloomingdale Linear Park."  TPL is set to receive a donation of the land from a local real estate developer who has been a long-time supporter of the trail and park plan.  The City also owns several adjacent parcels of land that together with the donation equal 25,000+ square feet of future parkland, equivalent to 8 city lots.  The Kimball Ave. site is the largest of all of the proposed access points for the future trail, due to the old railroad siding that used to exist there.  The City's ordinance also authorizes the conveyance of the land to the Chicago Park District.
