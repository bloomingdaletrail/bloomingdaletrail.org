The Chicago Journal ran a <a href="http://www.chicagojournal.com/main.asp?SectionID=25&SubSectionID=55&ArticleID=5984&TM=71867.18">story</a> and an <a href="http://www.chicagojournal.com/main.asp?SectionID=25&SubSectionID=173&ArticleID=5979&TM=71928.05">editorial</a> about the trail in last week's edition.  The story featured the impromptu park at Milwaukee Ave. in celebration of <a href="http://www.parkingday.org">PARK(ing) Day</a>.  Thank you to Trust for Public Land and <a href="http://www.christywebber.com/">Christy Webber Landscapes</a> for pitching in time and materials to help reclaim some car spots for a few hours.
