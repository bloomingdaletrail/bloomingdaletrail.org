<p>The Bloomingdale Trail is a featured tour as part of the City's <a href="http://www.greatchicagoplaces.us/">Great Chicago Spaces and Places</a>, May 19th and 20th. Tours will be led by our volunteer docents (thanks to everyone who came out last Thursday). The Saturday tour starts at 1:30 p.m., and the Sunday tour starts at 9:30 a.m., and lasts 2 hours. If you've never seen it in person, or you know of some friends who would be interested, this is a terrific opportunity to get up close and personal and get a great overview of the Trail.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.active.com/event_detail.cfm?event_id=1442177">Online registration</a> is available, and it's only $3. Don't miss it!</p>
