The stars are starting to align for the Bloomingdale Trail. The City, key not-for profits and community institutions are working together to make Chicago’s next great park a reality. Anyone who has been by the Trail at Whipple or Albany will be heartened to see signs declaring; “Future Park and Access to the Bloomingdale Trail!” 
<P>
Momentum is building. Now is the time for the community to come together around its vision for the future park and trail.  What are our hopes for the space? How will it support the health, economic vitality, arts and recreation across the Northwest side?
<P>
To help answer these questions please Join us on March 24th as the Friends of the Bloomingdale begins a community-led process to put forth a vision for what the trail will look like in 10 years. In this facilitated session we will look at examples from around the country and then work in small groups to brainstorming our ideas, our questions, our hopes and our concerns onto paper. 
<P>
WHEN: Saturday, March 24th, 10:00- 1:00<BR>
WHERE: ACME Art Works (1741 N. Western Ave.) <BR>
RSVP: info@bloomingdaletrail.org <p>

This is your first chance to inform the future design and engineering of the trail. All Friends of the Bloomingdale Trial, especially local residents living near the project, are welcome.  We seek a diversity of participants who will bring a diversity of ideas and visions to the table.  To keep the event manageable, we are asking residents to RSVP in advance.
<P>
Look Up! It’s the Bloomingdale Trail!
