<p>They City of Chicago released a <a href="http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_EDITORIAL/Spec69169.pdf">Request for Proposals</a> for construction engineering services for the Bloomingdale Trail.  This RFP covers Phase I (Preliminary Design) and is funded partly by federal congestion mitigation funds.  Responses are due by December 2, 2008. <p></p>
<p>Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail is working closely with the City and the Trust for Public Land to advance the trail's development and ensure community input shapes the final design.  We have held several community visioning exercises for local residents and other organizations including the Chicago Architecture Club have helped generate unique ideas to building the new greenway.  Following that work, the RFP calls for a consultant that "will work closely with stakeholders from the community to develop an attractive, world-class, sustainable and innovative design" and includes plans for a future community-drive charrette. <P></p>
<p>Background information for the RFP including our draft community visioning report can be viewed at the <a href="http://www.tpl.org/bloomingdaletrail">Trust for Public Land's Bloomingdale Trail site</a>.<br />
