<p>As many of you may know, the deadline recently passed for the
submission of proposals to the city of Chicago for the preliminary
design of the Bloomingdale Trail. Twenty-three teams have made
submissions, which is a high level of interest (the City requires each
team to be lead by a pre-qualified firm, of which there are just more
than 50).</p>

<p>If you would like to see the list of the leaders for each team, visit
the Chicago Department of Prourement Service&#8217;s <a href="http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/VCSearchWeb/org/cityofchicago/vcsearch/controller/bidTabs/search.do#searchResults">Bid Tabulation
database</a>, and enter <b><code>69169</code></b> in the &#8220;Specification
Number&#8221; field, and click &#8220;Search&#8221;.</p>
