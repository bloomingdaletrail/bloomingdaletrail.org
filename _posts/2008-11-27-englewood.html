<p>Ben Helphand, Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail board president, and I will be speaking about the Bloomingdale Trail in Englewood.  The event is a public discussion on the "Englewood-Heritage Rail Trail", a proposed reuse of an elevated railroad right of way in that community.  If you want to learn more about the Bloomingdale Trail or the Englewood project, join us. </p>

<p>The meeting is on Saturday, December 13, 2008, between 9:30am and noon, at the Kelly Library, 6151 S. Normal Boulevard.  If you plan to attend, contact Julie Samuels at Openlands, 312.863.6256, <a href="mailto:jsamuels@openlands.org">jsamuels@openlands.org</a> or John Paul Jones, Friends of the Parks, 312.857.2757, <a href="mailto:jonesjp@fotp.org">jonesjp@fotp.org</a>.  The closest elevated stop is Halsted on the green line.</p>
