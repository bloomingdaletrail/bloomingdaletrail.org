<p>The inaugural Chicago edition of <a href="http://www.biketraffic.org/content.php?id=1550_0_8_0">Sunday Parkways</a> took place yesterday, and the route took bikers, walkers, wheelchairs, and scooters under the Bloomingdale Trail along Humboldt Boulevard.</p>

<p>It was a great event and there was a large and enthusiastic turnout. Below is a video yours truly snapped as I biked (safely, with helmet on) under the Trail. The next Sunday Parkways is October 26 on the South Side. Be sure to get out there and support it, and let your local community leaders and politicians know that we want it to come back next year!</p>
