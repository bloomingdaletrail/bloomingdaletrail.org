	<p>The elevated embankment of the Bloomingdale Trail &#8211; with it&#8217;s bright yellow viaducts, great views of surrounding neighborhoods, and plentiful wild plant life &#8211; affords terrific photographic opportunities (check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahmorton/sets/72057594139740872/">Sarah Morton&#8217;s BT pics</a>, some of which adorn this site).</p>

	<p>In that vein, I&#8217;ve started a new <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/bloomingdaletrail/">group for photos of the Bloomingdale Trail</a> over at Flickr, the photo sharing site. It&#8217;s a public group, and accounts are free, so if you&#8217;ve ever snapped a shot of the Trail, or plan to, head over and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/bloomingdaletrail/">join the group</a> and add your BT photos to the pool. It&#8217;s easy, and it&#8217;ll be a great way for everyone in the community to watch and document as this crazy elevated, overgrown railroad evolves into the Trail we&#8217;re all looking forward to.</p>
