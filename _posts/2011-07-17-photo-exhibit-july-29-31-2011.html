Today the tracks are aligned to transform it into an elevated, mixed-use, linear park and trail. <em>Reframing Ruin </em>features photographs of the Trail as it is now, while inviting viewers to imagine the impact it will have for all of Chicago. This show is an opportunity to reflect on the ways this railroad has captured the spirit of discovery in so many. Generations of artists have turned the embankment walls into canvases. Youths have explored the accidental nature preserve that grew between the tracks. Walkers, bikers, runners and even skiers have blazed their paths, happily avoiding traffic below. Thanks to Bloomingdale’s views we’ve been able to see the communities along the route, and the Loop in the distance, with fresh eyes. We hope this show will be an inspiration as the process to design and build the Trail unfolds. Let us learn from the special qualities inherent in this ruin and translate them into Chicago’s next great park.<span style="white-space: pre;" mce_style="white-space: pre;"> </span>– Ben Helphand, President, Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Calibri;" mce_style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.0px Calibri;"><br></p>
