<p>We're very excited about this: join us this Friday, May 18th, for the opening of <em><a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/191958/" title="Upcoming.org event page">Envisioning the Bloomingdale</a></em>. This is an exhibit of early visions for the elevated park we're all hoping to see emerge on the Bloomingdale line. This Friday is the kick-off reception, free and open to the public. It's from <strong>6:30-8:30 p.m. at Acme Art Works, 1st floor, on 1741 N Western Ave</strong>.</p>
<p>The exhibit is sponsored by the Bloomingdale Trail Collaborative, but it's primarily the work of the <a href="http://www.chicagoarchitecturalclub.org/" title="check out CAC&apos;s website">Chicago Architectural Club</a>. They've put together a terrific collection of conceptual pieces from architects and planners to artists and kids. It's going to be very cool. <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/bloomingdaletrail.org/images/envisioning_the_bloomingdale.pdf">(Check out the great poster they did for it.)</a></p>
<p>The show runs through June 3rd. It's open Thursday through Sunday, noon to 5 p.m., and by appointment.</p>
<p>Hope to see you <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/191958/" title="Upcoming.org event page">Friday night</a>!</p>
