	<p>It&#8217;s been an eventful year full of positive developments for the prospects of a Trail, including the acquisition of property alongside the embankment at Whipple & Albany for a future park and access point, and next year promises to be even more momentous. Accordingly, we&#8217;re giving the website a face-lift and retooling it to better accommodate all of the news, information, and events surrounding the Trail. More details after the jump.</p>
	<p>You&#8217;ll see a new <a href="/history/">History</a> section, where we&#8217;ll flesh out the Trail&#8217;s past as best we can discover, as well as keep a page updated with the project&#8217;s <a href="/history/current-status">current status</a>, an easy way to get caught up with where we&#8217;re at.</p>

	<p>We&#8217;ve added a <a href="/maps/">Maps</a> section to collect all of the historical and current maps of the Trail, including a <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/bloomingdaletrail.org/maps/fbt.kml">layer for Google Earth</a>, and rail maps of Chicago&#8217;s past (special thanks for <span class="caps">FBT</span> member Greg Valent for pulling together these PDFs).</p>

	<p>We&#8217;ve also got a fleshed-out <a href="/volunteer/">Volunteer</a> page with some ideas for how to get involved; the start of a better <a href="/photos/">Photos</a> page for galleries of various images of the Trail; soon, an Events page will let you stay abreast of upcoming activities and FBT-sponsored events, like trail cleanup days and tours.</p>

	<p>This is just the beginning of a new effort to increase our online resources; some of the ideas being discussed include a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki</a> for collaboratively developing information; online forums for discussions; and multimedia, such as podcasts. We want to create an online community around the Trail that&#8217;s just as vibrant as the real-life, grassroots community we have today.</p>

	<p>One related note: we&#8217;d very much like to present the information on our website in Spanish as well as English, so if you&#8217;ve any interest in assisting with a translation effort, please <a href="/about/contact/">drop us a line</a>.</p>
