<P>Good news! The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning has recommended the Bloomingdale Trail for federal funding of $1.2 million in FY 2008 and $1.44 million in FY 2009 under the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program. This grant will enable the City to contract for the engineering and design of the trail (hopefully in early 2008). The total project is estimated at $41.8M and considerable fundraising remains before ground is broken, however this is an important milestone for our project.  </p>

<p>Details about this funding source can be found <a href="http://www.chicagoareaplanning.org/cmaq/fy2008_cmaq.asp">here</a>.</P>

<P>Thank you to Mayor Daley, our local Aldermen, Chicago Departments of Transportation and  Planning and Development, Chicago Park District and to the Trust for Public Land for their continuing support of the project. </P>
