<p>Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail and <a href="http://www.tpl.org/">The Trust for Public Land</a> invite
you join the committee for the Albany Whipple Park, just north of
Bloomingdale Avenue (and future trail!). The next meeting will be
<b>Thursday, April 30th, at 6pm at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=3028+W.+Armitage+Ave.,+Chicago+IL&amp;sll=41.934905,-87.711295&amp;sspn=0.008668,0.022702&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=41.917847,-87.703578&amp;spn=0.00867,0.022702&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">Atlas Cafe, 3028 W. Armitage
Avenue</a></b>
(at the corner of Whipple Avenue). Anyone is welcome to participate,
so please feel free to pass along this invitation. Please RSVP, so I
can give Atlas some notice of how many people to expect (if you do
not, come anyway).</p>

<p>The purpose of this committee is to be the stewards of the new park, helping
to maintain and improve it in partnership with the Chicago Park District,
the City, FBT, and TPL. The committee will also help advocate for the
construction of the Bloomingdale Trail over the next several years and
provide input to the city&#8217;s preliminary design process, which may begin in
2010.</p>

<p>The agenda for the first meeting includes:</p>

<ol>
<li>How should the park be maintained and improved?</li>
<li>Who would like the chair/co-chair this committee?</li>
<li>What are our next actions?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have any questions about this meeting, please feel free to call me at
(312) 427-1979.</p>
