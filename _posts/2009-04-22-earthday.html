<p>Here's another fun way to celebrate Earth Day today, Wednesday April 22nd.</p>

<p>FBT and Weegee's Lounge is partnering with the Ames Middle School staff in organizing a great Earth Day event to get the kids involved in the spirit of the day and clean up our neighborhood.   Here's a quick snapshot of the day's events: </p>

<p>Volunteer activities:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Walk with the kids and their teachers from Ames Middle School along a route centered on the Bloomingdale Trail and help with a neighborhood clean up and "cheerlead" to spur the kids on.  If you want to volunteer, arrive at 12:30 at Ames Middle School soccer field (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&q=1920+N.+Hamlin+Chicago+IL&fb=1&split=1&gl=us&cid=4079565054057063622&li=lmd&ll=41.916394,-87.721539&spn=0.03864,0.090809&z=14&iwloc=A">1920 N. Hamlin at Armitage</a>) and contact David Rodriguez with Ames to check-in.</p></li>
<li><p>Man debris collection sites at strategic positions along the Trail and help encourage the kids.  If you want to volunteer, stop be the Albany/Whipple park up materials at 1:30 to pick up some bags and gloves prior to heading to the collection site.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a strong showing from the community at the Albany/Whipple park to welcome the kids, finish the clean up and listen to a presentation about Earth Day and The Bloomingdale Trail.  If you can join, try and join us at around 2:00</p></li>
</ol>
