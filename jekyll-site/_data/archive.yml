- name: Envisioning the Bloomingdale poster
  date: 2007
  description: >
      For the May 2007 event: "The opening of Envisioning the Bloomingdale. This is an exhibit of
      early visions for the elevated park we’re all hoping to see emerge on
      the Bloomingdale line. This Friday is the kick-off reception, free and
      open to the public. It’s from 6:30-8:30 p.m. at Acme Art Works, 1st
      floor, on 1741 N Western Ave.

      The exhibit is sponsored by the Bloomingdale Trail Collaborative, but it’s
      primarily the work of the Chicago Architectural Club. They’ve put together
      a terrific collection of conceptual pieces from architects and planners to
      artists and kids. It’s going to be very cool. (Check out the great poster
      they did for it.)"

  description: >
      Throughout 2007 and 2008, FBT led a series of visioning sessions with the
      community, to hear, record, and summarize the ideas, concerns, and hopes
      for the Trail project. This document is the final product of that work,
      summarizing the findings. The findings would eventually inform the City's
      official RFP for design and construction.
